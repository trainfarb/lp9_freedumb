  - Decentralized Autonomous Education System built on Stacks
  - Can we create a global community with Australia as the hub?
  - Community of educators feeding into a community of learners
  - Support projects that kids are working on
  - Core of the project is financial literacy
  - Comes out of the idea that none of us had traditional financial literacy
  - Want to build a platform and open system that we can plug into anywhere so people can be fin lit moving forward
  - Get consensus between different defi networks to build consensus
  - Platform for problem based (what I learned from this course, what problem do I want to solve) into a project
- Students will be building the platforms themselves

Goals they like to share with chapter leads:
- Don't like to micromanage how chapter leads run their teams
1. number of smart contracts they can help us write in the network
2. onboarding new token holders (help learners do their first wallet etc)
3. Educate why Stacks is good for Bitcoin

For this community, do we break it off where there's a cert for educators?
What do teams typically use for communication?
Stacks korea is all telegram

High touch communication in the early days.
